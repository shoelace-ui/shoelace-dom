shoelace-dom
============

A tool to help analyze and understand your app's CSS-HTML relationship in the DOM.

When creating a traditional CSS/HTML UI, most of a designer's time is spent keeping them
(that is, the markup and the styles) in sync. The goal of this project is to eliminate this mental
overhead, by providing a constant stream of relevant, useful information.
